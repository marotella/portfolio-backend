    "bio": "I am a Software Engineering Intern with Academic Atlas, and attending a Software Engineering program with Hackbright on a full scholarship. I graduated from General Assembly's Software Engineering program in 2023. Prior to General Assembly, I discovered I enjoyed programming during the pandemic, and enrolled in a prep course focused on python. I have extensive professional experience in education, edTech, and consulting. I enjoy tackling complex problems to make doing hard work easier. Outside of work I love a great novel, preparing new recipes, planning my next trip, and spending time with my cat, Lou!"
